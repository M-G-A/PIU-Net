This Code consists of two files. 
1. The Matlab file was the first implementation for rendering spherical images from the point cloud. (A c++ version does exist)
2. The python file describes the structure of the network and the used losses. The files needed describing the circular convolutian can be found [here](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/en/research/ccnn.html).
