# PIU-Net
Generation of Virtual Panoramic Views from Colored Point Clouds

This Code consists of two files. 
1. The Matlab file was the first implementation for rendering spherical images from the point cloud. (A c++ version does exist)
2. The python file describes the structure of the network and the used losses. The files needed describing the circular convolutian can be found [here](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/etit/proaut/en/research/ccnn.html).
